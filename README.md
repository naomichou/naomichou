- 👋 Hi, I’m @naomichou
- 🏫 I'm currently an undergraduate student at UCLA majoring in Statistics and Data Science with minors in Digital Humanities and Professional Writing.
- 👀 I’m interested in pursuing a career in data science and data engineering. I also plan to attend graduate school after working for 1-2 years. 
- 🌱 I’m actively learning to expand my technical skillset - Python, SQL, Tableau, etc - by creating individual projects and participating in school events. 
- 📫 Please do not hesitate to reach me at naomichou@g.ucla.edu or my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomichou/
